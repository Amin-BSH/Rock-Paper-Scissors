# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This project is a Python-based implementation of the popular game "Rock, Paper, Scissors". It provides the opportunity to play the game against a computer, which makes its moves based on random choice.

## How to Play

1. Run the rock_paper_scissors.py script.
2. Choose your move (rock, paper, or scissors) by entering the corresponding number.
3. The computer will randomly select its move.
4. The winner of the round is determined based on the classic rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper
   beats rock.
5. The game continues for three rounds.
6. At the end of the game, the overall winner (or if it’s a draw) is displayed.
